general algo paradigms :-
brute force->exploring all possibility ( generally recursion) 
dp ->optimisation of brute force
greedy 
dnc

inbrute force , we optimise by two methods
prune the irrelevent calls 
trace one path and then revert to explore other possibility , 

so these two optimisation makes backtracking
